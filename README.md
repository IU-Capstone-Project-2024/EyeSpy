# EyeSpy

Our project aims to create a privacy-focused MacOS app that uses eye-tracking technology to ensure the integrity of remote exams and interviews. By leveraging advanced AI and local processing, we ensure that user data remains secure on their device. The app monitors eye gaze in real-time and triggers an alarm if the user is not looking at the screen, helping to prevent cheating without compromising privacy.
